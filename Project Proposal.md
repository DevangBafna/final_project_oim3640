# **Devang Bafna & Ziya Aydin: Project Proposal**

# **The Big Idea:**

*<div style="text-align: justify">College students are mostly dependent on a limited budget that they receive from their guardians. It is crucial that they track their income and expenses. However, we believe that we don't have a great tool to track the budget. So the main idea for our project is to create an application that allows students to input and view their expenses. For example, the viewing will be available in a tabular form as well as a pie chart split by category and a bar chart split by monthly expenditure. If possible, we would want to implement a feature that sends reminders to the user to input an expenditure or when they have $100 left in their budget. We believe this would be above a minimum viable product as it incorporates several elements of our coding journey and problem solving. In terms of a stretch goal, we would want to create a student life portal which would include several mini applications. For instance, it would not only have our expense/budget tracker but also a feature to find nearby restaurants based on location because campus food is not that great. Furthermore, it would display the weather in that location as well and also include a to-do list, in which students would input their daily tasks and keep track of them. Lastly, it would also include a GPA calculator for students to make sure they are on top of their academic career. However, this is a stretch due to the time constraints, so we will do our best to implement as many as we can.</div>*


# **Learning Goals:**

*<div style="text-align: justify">Shared Learning Goals:</div>*
*<div style="text-align: justify"> 1) We have less than a month to complete the project. So we want to learn and practice time management and milestone scheduling skills.</div>*
*<div style="text-align: justify"> 2) We do not have a tool like Google Docs where we can meet on the code at the same time. So we want to learn and practice team management and organization skills.</div>*
   
*<div style="text-align: justify"> Ziya’s Learning Goals:</div>* 
*<div style="text-align: justify"> 1) Learn how to use an API for problem solving.</div>*
*<div style="text-align: justify"> 2) Learn how to implement multiple frameworks into one working application (Flask, API).</div>*

*<div style="text-align: justify"> Devang’s Learning Goals:</div>*
*<div style="text-align: justify"> 1) Learn how to implement multiple tools together to form a real-world application that would actually help solve a problem.</div>*
*<div style="text-align: justify"> 2) Learn how to work with a partner on a coding project especially with a language that we both just learned.</div>*

# **Implementation Plan:**

*<div style="text-align: justify">As of now, from all the brainstorming, we believe that we will be using a couple of  libraries such as Flask, matplotlib (for graphs), and most importantly a new library called sqlite3. The reason why we would need a database in our project is because every user would have a login and password and have access to their own expenses which shouldn’t be accessible to everyone. If this does get complicated as none of us have done this before, we will make this expense tracker for our own personal use and only we can use it. As a side feature, we are also planning on having a weather API in the corner of the application which would show the user the current weather in their location. However, this is subject to change based on a conversation with Professor Li.</div>*

# **Collaboration plan:**

*<div style="text-align: justify">We are going to have synchronous and asynchronous work to complete the project. Most of the time we will be pair programming because we believe that we can maximize the learning by doing so. We are planning to meet 3 times a week. 2 of them will be in-person right after our classes. The third meeting is going to be an online meeting on Saturdays. We will be using WhatsApp and Webex to communicate	 with each other so that we can schedule timings and work side by side with shared screens. In terms of work, we will be splitting that evenly. For example, Devang would handle the code for the pie chart and then Ziya would handle the code for the bar chart and we would cross check and evaluate each other’s work. Therefore, we believe the agile development framework would be better suited for us as we are simultaneously working on different phases of the project. And after completing that phase, we will be testing and debugging the code.</div>*

# **Risks:**

*<div style="text-align: justify">We believe that the time constraint is our major risk. We need to present the Final Demo on April 26th. So we should make sure that we will not fall behind the schedule. Another big risk to the success of this project is that it might not work in the end. This is a risk that we are willing to take because we believe that if we put in the right amount of effort and dedication, we can make this work especially with leaving plenty of time for debugging.</div>*

# **Additional Course Content:**

*<div style="text-align: justify">We can learn more about Flask and HTML. We are confident with the coding part but we think that we can practice Flask web application and HTML more. We haven’t gotten the opportunity to dive deeper into the machine learning and numpy and pandas library, so that is a big area to explore in class and we believe it would be helpful for any project.</div>*
